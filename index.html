                    <h3>Dear Edward,<br/><br/>
                    Please click anywhere to draw a heart, or use the buttons to change equation. Inspired by
                        the heart that you drew on my card, Equation B will outline itself in the same way, I hope you like it :) <br/><br />
                        Thank you so much for being my boyfriend, I love you. You are too good for me and too good to be true,
                        it feels like a miracle to me and sometimes I find it hard to believe that you are real.
                        Every time we meet, I feel myself falling in love with you all over again. <br /> <br />
                        You are so gorgeous, cute and hot. You have all the best vibes; you're so clever, nerdy and pragmatic; sassy 
                        and determined. If I could, I'd like to be more like you. I am so proud to be yours. <br /> <br />
                        This Christmas, although we are apart, please accept this token of my love for you and of how much I 
                        have been missing you while you're away. When you come back, we can get ingredients for you to cook
                        in your new wok (lol) and we'll do Christmas and cuddling vibes. Hopefully, I'll be able to give you
                        a suitable work space and support you to study as needed, too. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        Ed, I wouldn't have even have ventured to pray for someone as perfect as you to be with me,
                        and wouldn't have been able to imagine it if I had tried; 
                        you make me want to stay on the earth forever. I love you so much.

                        <br/><br/>
                        With all my heart,<br/>
                        Merry Christmas,<br/>
                        Tommy
